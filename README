Question 1:

How many processes are created?
    Answer: Four processes will be created.
How these processes are created, especially who is created by .
    Answer: If main process fork successfully, it will break.
            The child process will contiune run for().
Diagram:
    ---> = Create
       * = Parent
       + = Child
    *Terminal ---> +Main process
                   *Main process ---> +process1
                                      *process1 ---> +process2
                                                     *process2 ---> +process3
              
Question 2:

How many processes are created?
    Answer: Five processes will be created.
How these processes are created, especially who is created by .
    Answer: If child process fork successfully or unsuccessfully, it will break.
            The main process will contiune run for().
Diagram:
    ---> = Create
       * = Parent
       + = Child
    *Terminal ---> +Main process
    *Main process ---> +process1 or *Main process ---> fail
    *Main process ---> +process2 or *Main process ---> fail
    *Main process ---> +process3 or *Main process ---> fail
    *Main process ---> +process4 or *Main process ---> fail

Question 3:

How many processes are created?
    Answer: Eight processes will be created.
How these processes are created, especially who is created by.
    Answer: If main process and child process fork unsuccessfully, it will break.
            Or child process and main process will contiune run for().
Diagram:
    ---> = Create
       * = Parent
       + = Child
    *Terminal ---> +Main process
                   *Main process ---> +process1 or *Main process ---> fail
                   *Main process ---> +process2 or *Main process ---> fail
                   *Main process ---> +process3 or *Main process ---> fail
                                      *process1 ---> +process4 or *process1 ---> fail
                                      *process1 ---> +process5 or *process1 ---> fail
                                      *process2 ---> +process6 or *process2 ---> fail
                                                     *process4 ---> +process7 or *process4 ---> fail

Question 4:

What is this distribution called?
    Answer: It was called `Binomial distribution`.
What is the reason you believe the histogram is the named distribution by you?
    Answer: I set a random number as 10, it means the final box.
            The ball drop in number k box, and drop left (10-k) times, drop right k times.
            To get Probability: P( X = k ) = C10 * (1/2)^k *(1/2)^(10-k) = C10 * (1/2)^10 , k=0,1,2,3,4,5,....10
                                               k                             k
            We can get following answer.
            X |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  |  10  |
              |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |      |
            P |0.001|0.009|0.043|0.117|0.205|0.246|0.205|0.117|0.043|0.009|0.0010|

            Because the answer is similar to the histogram,
             we can think that the pinball distribution is `Binomial distribution`.
