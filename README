    ---> = Create
       * = Parent
       + = Child
    *Terminal ---> +Main process
                   *Main process ---> +process1
                                      *process1 ---> +process2
                                                     *process2 ---> +process3
              
Question 2:

How many processes are created?
    Answer: Five processes will be created.
How these processes are created, especially who is created by .
    Answer: If child process fork successfully or unsuccessfully, it will break.
           The main process will contiune run for().
Diagram:
    ---> = Create
       * = Parent
       + = Child
    *Terminal ---> +Main process
    *Main process ---> +process1 or *Main process ---> fail
    *Main process ---> +process2 or *Main process ---> fail
    *Main process ---> +process3 or *Main process ---> fail
    *Main process ---> +process4 or *Main process ---> fail

Question 3:

How many processes are created?
    Answer: Eight processes will be created.
How these processes are created, especially who is created by.
    Answer: If main process and child process fork unsuccessfully, it will break.
            Or child process and main process will contiune run for().

    ---> = Create
       * = Parent
       + = Child
    *Terminal ---> +Main process
                   *Main process ---> +process1 or *Main process ---> fail
                   *Main process ---> +process2 or *Main process ---> fail
                   *Main process ---> +process3 or *Main process ---> fail
                                      *process1 ---> +process4 or *process1 ---> fail
                                      *process1 ---> +process5 or *process1 ---> fail
                                      *process2 ---> +process6 or *process2 ---> fail
                                                     *process4 ---> +process7 or *process4 ---> fail
